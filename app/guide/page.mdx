## !steps Choose a project

In this tutorial you can use any existing Next.js project, or you can create a new one.

Open the chosen project in your code editor.

Next, start your Next.js app in development mode by running:

```js george.js
const houses = [
  "Stark",
  "Lannister",
  "Baratheon",
  "Targaryen",
]

const winner =
  houses[
    Math.floor(
      Math.random() * houses.length,
    )
  ]

console.log(`Iron Throne: ${winner}`)
```

## !steps Install Inngest

With the Next.js app now running running open a new tab in your terminal. In your project directory's root, run the following command to install Inngest SDK:

```js george.js
const houses = [
  "Stark",
  "Lannister",
  "Baratheon",
  "Targaryen",
]

const clash = () => {
  const winner =
    houses[
      Math.floor(
        Math.random() * houses.length,
      )
    ]
  return `${winner} wins the battle!`
}

console.log(clash())
```

## !steps Create an Inngest client

The third book, A Storm of Swords, is known for its intense and shocking developments. Battles rage on, alliances shift, and characters face unexpected challenges and betrayals, making it one of the most thrilling books in the series.

```js george.js
const houses = [
  "Stark",
  "Lannister",
  "Baratheon",
]

const reveal = () => {
  const traitor =
    houses[
      Math.floor(
        Math.random() * houses.length,
      )
    ]
  return `${traitor} betrays the alliance!`
}

console.log(reveal())
```

## !steps Write your first Inngest function

A Feast for Crows, the fourth book, explores the aftermath of the wars, with a focus on the characters in the southern regions of Westeros. It delves into the politics and power struggles in a kingdom weary of battle.

```js george.js
const houses = [
  "Martell",
  "Lannister",
  "Baratheon",
  "Tyrell",
]

const intrigue = () => {
  const ally1 =
    houses[
      Math.floor(
        Math.random() * houses.length,
      )
    ]
  const ally2 =
    houses[
      Math.floor(
        Math.random() * houses.length,
      )
    ]
  return `${ally1} and ${ally2} form an alliance!`
}

console.log(intrigue())
```

## !steps A Dance with Dragons

A Dance with Dragons, the fifth book, runs concurrently with A Feast for Crows and focuses on the characters in the North and across the Narrow Sea. The story advances with dragons, the Nightâ€™s Watch, and the lingering threat of winter.

  "Baratheon",
  "Targaryen",

const dragons = () => {
  const dragon =
    houses[
      Math.floor(
        Math.random() * houses.length,
      )
    ]
  return `${dragon} has a dragon!`
}

console.log(dragons())
```

## !steps The Winds of Winter

## !steps Quick start

In this tutorial you will add Inngest to a Next.js app to see how easy it can be to build complex workflows.

Inngest makes it easy to build, manage, and execute reliable workflows. Some use cases include scheduling drip marketing campaigns and payment flows, or chaining LLM interactions.

By the end of this ten-minute tutorial you will:

- Set up and run Inngest on your machine.
- Write your first Inngest function.
- Trigger your function from code and Inngest Dev Server.

In this tutorial you can use any existing Next.js project, or you can create a new one.

Open the chosen project in your code editor.

Next, start your Next.js app in development mode by running:

```bash !ch-exclude
npm run dev
```

## !steps Install Inngest

With the Next.js app now running running open a new tab in your terminal. In your project directory's root, run the following command to install Inngest SDK:

```js george.js
const houses = [
  "Stark",
  "Lannister",
  "Baratheon",
  "Targaryen",
]

const clash = () => {
  const winner =
    houses[
      Math.floor(
        Math.random() * houses.length,
      )
    ]
  return `${winner} wins the battle!`
}

console.log(clash())
```

## !steps Create an Inngest client

The third book, A Storm of Swords, is known for its intense and shocking developments. Battles rage on, alliances shift, and characters face unexpected challenges and betrayals, making it one of the most thrilling books in the series.

```ts src/inngest/client.ts
import { Inngest } from "inngest"

// Create a client to send and receive events
export const inngest = new Inngest({
  id: "my-app",
})
```

## !steps Write your first Inngest function

A Feast for Crows, the fourth book, explores the aftermath of the wars, with a focus on the characters in the southern regions of Westeros. It delves into the politics and power struggles in a kingdom weary of battle.

```ts src/app/api/inngest/route.ts
import { serve } from "inngest/next"
import { inngest } from "../../../inngest/client"

// Create an API that serves zero functions
export const { GET, POST, PUT } = serve({
  client: inngest,
  functions: [
    /* your functions will be passed here later! */
  ],
})
```

## !steps A Dance with Dragons

A Dance with Dragons, the fifth book, runs concurrently with A Feast for Crows and focuses on the characters in the North and across the Narrow Sea. The story advances with dragons, the Nightâ€™s Watch, and the lingering threat of winter.

```js george.js
const houses = [
  "Stark",
  "Lannister",
  "Baratheon",
  "Targaryen",
]

const dragons = () => {
  const dragon =
    houses[
      Math.floor(
        Math.random() * houses.length,
      )
    ]
  return `${dragon} has a dragon!`
}

console.log(dragons())
```

## !steps The Winds of Winter

The Winds of Winter, the anticipated sixth book, is expected to continue the intricate storylines and bring new twists and turns to the world of Westeros. Fans eagerly await its release.

```js george.js
const houses = [
  "Stark",
  "Lannister",
  "Baratheon",
  "Targaryen",
  "Martell",
  "Tyrell",
  "Greyjoy",
]

const winterIsComing = () => {
  const isComing = Math.random() > 0.99
  if (isComing) {
    return "Winter is coming!"
  } else {
    return "Winter is not coming."
  }
}

console.log(winterIsComing())
```

## !steps A Dream of Spring

A Dream of Spring is the proposed final book in the series, anticipated to conclude the epic saga. It remains one of the most awaited books in modern fantasy literature.

```js george.js
const houses = [
  "Stark",
  "Lannister",
  "Baratheon",
  "Targaryen",
  "Martell",
  "Tyrell",
  "Greyjoy",
]

const keepDreaming = () => {
  return "Not gonna happen..."
}

console.log(keepDreaming())
```

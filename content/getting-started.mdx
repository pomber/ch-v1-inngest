# Quick Start

In this tutorial you will add Inngest to a Next.js app to see how easy it can be to build complex workflows.

Inngest makes it easy to build, manage, and execute reliable workflows. Some use cases include scheduling drip marketing campaigns and payment flows, or chaining LLM interactions.

By the end of this ten-minute tutorial you will:

- Set up and run Inngest on your machine.
- Write your first Inngest function.
- Trigger your function from code and Inngest Dev Server.

## !steps Quick start

In this tutorial you can use any existing Next.js project, or you can create a new one.

Open the chosen project in your code editor.

Next, start your Next.js app in development mode by running:

```bash !ch-exclude
npm run dev
```

The third book, A Storm of Swords, is known for its intense and shocking developments. Battles rage on, alliances shift, and characters face unexpected challenges and betrayals, making it one of the most thrilling books in the series.

## !steps Install Inngest

Next, start the Inngest Dev Server, which is a fast, in-memory version of Inngest where you can quickly send and view events events and function runs:

```bash !ch-exclude
npx inngest-cli@latest dev
```

In your browser open http://localhost:8288 to see the development UI where later you will test the functions you write:

## !steps Create an Inngest client

The third book, A Storm of Swords, is known for its intense and shocking developments. Battles rage on, alliances shift, and characters face unexpected challenges and betrayals, making it one of the most thrilling books in the series.

```ts src/inngest/client.ts
import { Inngest } from "inngest"

// Create a client to send and receive events
export const inngest = new Inngest({
  id: "my-app",
})
```

```ts src/app/api/inngest/route.ts
import { serve } from "inngest/next"
import { inngest } from "../../../inngest/client"

// Create an API that serves zero functions
export const { GET, POST, PUT } = serve({
  client: inngest,
  functions: [
    /* your functions will be passed here later! */
  ],
})
```

## !steps Write your first Inngest function

A Feast for Crows, the fourth book, explores the aftermath of the wars, with a focus on the characters in the southern regions of Westeros. It delves into the politics and power struggles in a kingdom weary of battle.

```ts src/inngest/functions.ts
import { inngest } from "./client"

export const helloWorld =
  inngest.createFunction(
    { id: "hello-world" },
    { event: "test/hello.world" },
    async ({ event, step }) => {
      await step.sleep(
        "wait-a-moment",
        "1s",
      )
      return {
        event,
        body: "Hello, World!",
      }
    },
  )
```

```ts src/app/api/inngest/route.ts
import { serve } from "inngest/next"
import { inngest } from "../../../inngest/client"
import { helloWorld } from "../../../inngest/functions"

export const { GET, POST, PUT } = serve({
  client: inngest,
  functions: [
    helloWorld, // <-- This is where you'll always add all your functions
  ],
})
```

Something about [client.ts](!src/inngest/client.ts), spotlink.

## !steps Trigger your function from the development UI

A Dance with Dragons, the fifth book, runs concurrently with A Feast for Crows and focuses on the characters in the North and across the Narrow Sea. The story advances with dragons, the Nightâ€™s Watch, and the lingering threat of winter.

## !steps Trigger from code

The Winds of Winter, the anticipated sixth book, is expected to continue the intricate storylines and bring new twists and turns to the world of Westeros. Fans eagerly await its release.

```ts src/app/api/hello/route.ts
import { NextResponse } from "next/server"
import { inngest } from "../../../inngest/client" // Import our client

// Opt out of caching; every request should send a new event
export const dynamic = "force-dynamic"

// Create a simple async Next.js API route handler
export async function GET() {
  // Send your event payload to Inngest
  await inngest.send({
    name: "test/hello.world",
    data: {
      email: "testFromNext@example.com",
    },
  })

  return NextResponse.json({
    name: "Hello Inngest from Next!",
  })
}
```
